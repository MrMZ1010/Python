# Machine Learning and Image Processing Projects

This repository contains Python code for machine learning and image processing projects. Below is an overview of each file and its purpose

## 1. MachineLearning.ipynb
This notebook contains machine learning code that demonstrates various machine learning techniques. It includes the following:

- **Data loading and preprocessing**: Preparing datasets for analysis
- **Model building**: Building machine learning models using popular libraries like `scikit-learn`
- **Training and evaluation**: Training models on datasets and evaluating their performance
- **Visualization**: Plotting results and insights using libraries such as `matplotlib`

## 2. Matplotlib.ipynb
This notebook is focused on data visualization using the `matplotlib` library. It includes examples of:

- **Creating line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots**
- **Customizing graphs**: Titles, labels, legends, and other visual adjustments
- **Displaying and saving plots**

## 3. Numbers.py
This script uses OpenCV to process and segment images. Specifically, it:

- Reads an input image called `Numbers.jpg` from the `Input/` folder
- Converts the image to grayscale for further processing
- Divides the image into small sections and saves each section as a separate image
- Outputs the segmented images into corresponding folders named `0`, `1`, ..., `9` inside the `Output/` directory
