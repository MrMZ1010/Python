## Introduction

In this project, we analyze the nutrient content of various foods using a dataset of food nutrients. The analysis includes standardizing nutrient values and visualizing these metrics for better comparison.

## Data Collection

We use a dataset containing nutrient information for various foods. The dataset should include the following columns:
- `food_name`
- `calories`
- `protein`
- `fat`
- `carbohydrates`
- `fiber`
- `sugar`

## Feature Engineering

The analysis includes calculating the following features:
- Standardized values for each nutrient (calories, protein, fat, carbohydrates, fiber, sugar).

## Analysis and Visualization

The data is analyzed and visualized using various plots:
- Bar plot of standardized nutrient values for all foods.

## Results

The results of the analysis are visualized through the following plots:
- **Nutrient Comparison Across Foods**: A bar plot showing the standardized nutrient values for all foods.
