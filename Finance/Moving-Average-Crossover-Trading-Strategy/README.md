# Moving Average Crossover Trading Strategy

This project implements a simple **Moving Average Crossover Trading Strategy** using Python, focusing on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**. The strategy uses two moving averages: a short-term and a long-term moving average to generate buy and sell signals.

## Features

- **Moving Average Calculation**: Efficiently calculates moving averages using a sliding window technique.
- **Trading Signals**: Generates buy signals when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average, and sell signals when it crosses below.
- **OOP Principles**: The strategy is implemented using classes (`TradingStrategy` and `MovingAverage`), encapsulating the trading logic and moving average calculation.
- **DSA Concepts**: Demonstrates an efficient way to handle data with sliding windows and lists for managing price history.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**
- **NumPy** (for random price generation, or you can use real price data)
