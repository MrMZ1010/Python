# Order Book for a Cryptocurrency Exchange

This project implements a simple **Order Book** for a cryptocurrency exchange using **Python**. It focuses on **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and advanced **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** concepts, specifically using **priority queues (heaps)** to efficiently manage buy and sell orders and match them based on price priority.

## Features

- **Efficient Order Matching**: Uses heaps (priority queues) to quickly match the best buy and sell orders.
- **Buy and Sell Orders**: Handles placing of buy and sell orders with price and quantity.
- **OOP Design**: The order book, orders, and matching engine are implemented using Python classes, encapsulating functionality.
- **Advanced DSA**: Uses **min-heaps** and **max-heaps** to store and access the highest priority orders in logarithmic time.

### Prerequisites

- **Python**
