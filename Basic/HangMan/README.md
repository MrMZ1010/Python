# Python Mini-Projects Overview

This repository contains a collection of mini-projects implemented in Python. Each project demonstrates different aspects of Python programming and can serve as a learning resource for beginners.

## Projects Included:

### Hangman Game

This project implements a simple hangman game where the user has to guess letters of a randomly chosen word. The user has a limited number of chances to guess the word correctly.

### GCD and LCM Calculator

This project calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) and least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers entered by the user.

### Unique Random Number Generator

This project generates a list of unique random numbers based on the user's input. The user specifies the number of random numbers they want, and the program ensures that each number in the list is unique.

### Odd-Even Pattern Generator

This project generates a string of asterisks ('*') and hashtags ('#') alternately based on the length entered by the user. The resulting string forms a pattern where '*' represents even indices and '#' represents odd indices.

### Sorted List Checker

This project prompts the user to enter a list of numbers and checks if the list is sorted in ascending order. It compares the original list with its sorted version to determine if the list is sorted.

Each project includes a brief description, file name, and a summary of its functionality. For detailed explanations and usage instructions, refer to the comments within each code snippet.

## How to Run:
