# Sliding Puzzle Game

A classic sliding puzzle game implemented in Python with a graphical user interface using PySide6.

## Overview

The Sliding Puzzle Game is a desktop application where players arrange shuffled numbers in sequential order within a grid. The objective is to rearrange the numbers by sliding them into the empty cell until the numbers are sorted from 1 to 15. The game provides a randomized initial state, and players can interact with the game by clicking on the numbered tiles to slide them into adjacent empty cells.

- Interactive Gameplay: Players can slide numbered tiles into adjacent empty cells by clicking on them.
- Win Detection: The game automatically detects when the player successfully arranges the numbers in sequential order and displays a victory message.
