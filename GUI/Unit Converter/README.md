# Python Projects Overview

This repository contains two Python projects:

1. **Text Converter App**: A desktop application for text conversion and clipboard management.
2. **Sliding Puzzle Game**: A classic sliding puzzle game implemented with a graphical user interface.

## Text Converter App

### Overview

The Text Converter App is a desktop application built using PySide6 for the GUI and pyperclip for clipboard operations. It allows users to convert text by removing line breaks based on their preferences and copying the modified text to the clipboard.

### Features

- Remove line breaks: Users can choose between two options to remove line breaks: single line breaks (`\n`) or both single and Windows-style line breaks (`\r\n`).
- Copy to clipboard: Users can easily copy the converted text to the clipboard with a single click.

### Installation

To install and run the Text Converter App, follow the instructions provided in the project's README file.

## Sliding Puzzle Game

### Overview

The Sliding Puzzle Game is a Python application with a graphical user interface developed using PySide6. It is a classic sliding puzzle game where players arrange shuffled numbers in sequential order within a grid. The game provides a randomized initial state, and players can interact with the game by clicking on the numbered tiles to slide them into adjacent empty cells.

### Features

- Randomized Puzzle: The game initializes with a randomized arrangement of numbers from 1 to 15 within a 4x4 grid.
- Interactive Gameplay: Players can slide numbered tiles into adjacent empty cells by clicking on them.
- Win Detection: The game automatically detects when the player successfully arranges the numbers in sequential order and displays a victory message.

## Contributing

Contributions to improve the game's features, user interface, or code structure are welcome. Please feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
