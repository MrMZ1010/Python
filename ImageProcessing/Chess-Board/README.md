# Chessboard Pattern with OpenCV

This project creates a simple 8x8 chessboard pattern using NumPy and OpenCV in Python. The code generates a 560x560 pixel image, where each square is 70x70 pixels, alternating between black and white.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library
- OpenCV library

## Example

The code will generate an image of a chessboard, display it, and save the image as `chess-board.jpg`.
