# Image Inversion with OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to invert the colors of an image using NumPy and OpenCV in Python. The code reads an image, inverts its colors, displays the result, and saves the inverted image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library
- OpenCV library

## Example

The code will invert the colors of the `woman.jpg` image, display the inverted image, and save it as `Emilia.jpg`.
