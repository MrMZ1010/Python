# Image Processing with OpenCV

This project demonstrates basic image processing techniques using OpenCV in Python. The code reads an image, resizes it, converts it to grayscale, draws a black diagonal line across the image, and then displays and saves the modified image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

## Example

The code will process the `simons.jpg` image, add a black diagonal line, and display the modified image. The modified image is saved as `black-tape.jpg`.
