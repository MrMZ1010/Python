# Image Resizing and Rotation with OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to resize and rotate an image using OpenCV in Python. The code reads an image, resizes it, rotates it by 180 degrees, displays the result, and saves the rotated image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library

## Example

The code will resize the `sad-men.jpg` image to 1000x600 pixels, rotate it by 180 degrees, display the rotated image, and save it as `happy-men.jpg`.
