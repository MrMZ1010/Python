# Drawing the Letter 'M' with OpenCV

This project demonstrates how to create an image of the letter 'M' using NumPy and OpenCV in Python. The code generates a 600x600 pixel image, draws the letter 'M' using black lines, and displays and saves the image.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library
- OpenCV library

## Example

The code will generate an image of the letter 'M' on a white background, display it, and save the image as `letter_M.jpg`.
