# Gradient Image Creation with OpenCV

This project creates a gradient image using NumPy and OpenCV in Python. The code generates an image where the pixel values gradually decrease from top to bottom, creating a smooth gradient effect.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy library
- OpenCV library

## Example

The code will generate a 255x255 pixel gradient image, display it, and save the image as `gradient.jpg`.
